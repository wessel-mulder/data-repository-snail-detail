# This folder contains the scripts used in visualisation of results

The R script _confusion-matrix-f1-scores.R_ was used to visualise the **HQ classification** results. The output graphs consist of two panels; a confusion matrix on the left and the F1-scores for each class on the right. 

The R script _accuracies-synthetic-adjustments.R_ was used to visualise the **mAP50 values of the different synthetic-trained models**. The script generates one graph per group of adjustments, and pastes an example image of each synthetic dataset under the graph.

The R script _sensetivity-tiles.R_ was used to generate **the heatmap for the different numbers of images used in data synthesis**.
