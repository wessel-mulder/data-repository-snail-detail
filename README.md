# data-repository-snail-detail
This repository contains the scripts used in data pre-processing, synthetic-data generation, model-preparation and visualisation of results for my MSc thesis 'Snail detail: Identification of _Schistosoma_ intermediate host snails with synthetic-data trained computer vision networks'.

This folder is divided as per these five 'main' computational steps. Descriptions of the scripts and data are contained in separate README.md files in every folder. 
The folders are named as follows: 

_pre-processing:_ This folder contains the script used in removing the backgrounds of images and automatic cropping to image extent

_synthetic-data-generation:_ This folder contains the script used to generate synthetic data for the base synthetic data pipeline.

_model-preparation:_ This folder contains multiple scripts and example files for splitting the synthetic data and HQ images into training/validation subsets for both classification and detection. It contains a script to count the number of individuals represented in the synthetic dataset.

_model-testing:_ This folder contains the scripts used in testing of classification and detection accuracies.

_results-visualisation:_ This folder contains the scripts for visualisation of classification and detection accuracies.

The images used in my project are not shared publicly as they are not my property.
