# data-repository-snail-detail
This repository contains the scripts used in data pre-processing, synthetic-data generation, model-preparation and visualisation of results for my MSc thesis 'Snail detail: Identification of _Schistosoma_ intermediate host snails with synthetic-data trained computer vision networks'.

This folder is divided as per these four 'main' computational steps, along with some example images and data so one can visualise how the scripts work. 
Descriptions of the scripts and data are contained in separate README.md files in every folder. 
The folders are named as follows: 

The data used in my project is not shared publicly as it is not mine to share.
